###### A Utility for Checking SSL Ciphers against CipherSuite's API

This is a small script I wrote to automate the testing of testing for Weak SSL Ciphers on Domains & IP Addresses.
The code is NOT perfect, what so ever. I just threw it together to make my life easier.

I may improve this in the future and make it something kinda-cool.

*Requires TestSSL to be installed. - Modify `TESTSSL_INSTALL_LOCATION` within `run.sh` to point to your install for it to work properly.*
